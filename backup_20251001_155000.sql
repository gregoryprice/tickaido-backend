Clear out the sample values in Row Two and replace with your shipment data, using the same format for respective columns. On the Shipments page in Shipwell, click \\"Import\\" and upload this spreadsheet. The sheet will be validated, and when all errors are corrected, it will save the data to your Shipments list. The import may take a few minutes to complete. \\n\\nIMPORTANT: \\n- The Customer Reference # field is the field that is used to determine if a shipment is being created or updated. Accordingly, if you have a Customer Reference # that is the same as an existing shipment then it will update the existing shipment instead of creating a new one.\\n- If more than two stops (one pickup and one delvery) are needed then you need to repeat the columns Supplier ID or Customer ID through Notify when Delivered. Note the Supplier ID and Customer ID fields will reference your Extrenal Reference ID provided in the Address Book if leveraging the Address Book.\\n- If you have multiple product line items then you will need to add additional columns from \\"Product Reference\\" to \\"Hazmat Code\\". \\n- If you have custom data then you need to use the exact name of the Custom Data as the column. For Custom Stop and Custom Line data make sure to place the custom data column in the appropriate order lined up with the stop or the line item.\\n\\nThere are two example pages: \\"1 Leg and 1 Product Example\\" for one shipment leg and one product line items and a \\"2 Legs - 2 Line Items w Custom Data Example\\" for two legs within the single shipment and two product line items and it has custom data examples.  Below are the column definitions and additional examples of valid data. Column Required? Sample Data Potential Values (if limited) Default Value (if empty) \\"Maximum Length \\n(spaces & symbols count)\\" Definition Notes Tags N DC124, DAMAGED Alphanumeric value to represent the 'Tag' in Shipwell. This represents existing tags that are available. You cannot create new tags. Further, if multiple tags are being added then separate with a comma. Customer Account N (unless if 3PL) Mary's Supplies Alphanumeric value to represent the 'Customer' in Shipwell. Must be an existing Customer Account within Shipwell for your environment. Needs to match the \\"Company Name\\" value from the Manage, Customer screen. Customer Reference #* N WB 435 Alphanumeric value to represent the order number in Shipwell. This field is evaluated to determine if a record is a new shipment being created or a shipment is being updated. It is important to not reuse this number across shipments to ensure that the right shipment is updated.

Import Issue	Really bad thing is happening with the order importer. The issue is occurring consistently on Shipment 345678, causing a significant impact of 20 hours of lost productivity per day. I'm currently trying to troubleshoot by redoing the import, but it's still happening in production. The expected behavior is that it should be able to successfully ingest the files uploaded. To reproduce the issue, log in to the platform, click on the import file option on the orders page.
